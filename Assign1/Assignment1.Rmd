# 1. Child Safety Seat Survey

## 1.1

Canada has a Road Safety Vision of having the safest roads in the world. Yet, the leading cause of death of Canadian children remains vehicle crashes. In 2006, a national child safety seat survey was conducted by an AUTO21 research team in collaboration with Transport Canada to empirically measure Canadaâ€™s progress toward achieving Road Safety Vision 20210. Child seat use was observed in parking lots and nearby intersections in 200 randomly selected sites across Canada.
